- 👋 Hi, I’m @jjhonanohjj
- 👀 I’m interested in illustration, theatrical design, creative writing (specifically playwriting as of recent), and learning more about different types of programming and development (not sure what path I want to go in since I'm still researching a lot of the options).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scratch, relearning HTML and CSS, and just the general gist of Python and other programming languages and their uses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something soon, possibly, still not sure where I want to get started.
- 📫 How to reach me on most social media at my handle @jjhonanohjj !
